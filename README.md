# User-Login-with-email-verification
A User Login system that runs in the familiar SignUp-and-SignIn mode and it allows us to authenticate our users with a token exchange verification of their email address. This initial authentication is followed by subsequent password logins to access resources.

This is a short video introduction to the Login System user interface. This demo is running on a LAMP stack in the AWS Lightsail cloud and it uses Amazon SES for the email access. The backend code is PHP with the Postfix library as the mail handler. The user database functions are straightforward inline mySQLi procedures. The UI is plain HTML, CSS, and PHP with a Bootstrap flavor.
